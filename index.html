<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h1>COMP110 Final Project</h1>
<h2>Minesweeper</h2>
<p>For this project, I made a Minesweeper game.  Instead of using numbers to identify where the bombs are placed, I used colors.  Green signifies that there is no bomb in the eight squares surrounding the block.  Yellow indicates that there is a bomb in one of those blocks.  Red indicates that you have hit a bomb and lost the game.</p>
